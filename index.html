        <p>When coding in HTML, the most important thing is learning the syntax. Without that base knowledge, you will be lost when studying HTML codes. 
          There are many ways to learn this but you will never be able to apply the syntax untill you practice. I have listed a few suggestions below 
          but make sure that once you start you stick with it.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML, in short, is the language that tells the browser what is on screen. The syntax dictates how the informaiton shows on screen. There are
              many different elements involved in HTML but once you learn the basics of the syntax, it becomes much easier to read code. Of course the best 
              way to learn coding is to simply start coding. </li>
              <li>The best site I have found for learning is freeCodeCamp.com. This cite will teach you by having you complete coding tasks which is the best way to  
                not only learn but remeber what you learned! </li>
          </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="CSS">
        <header>CSS</header>
        <p>The most important thing to remeber about CSS code is that each selector is used to target the specified class. It took me a while to learn how different 
          elements effect the class or id and that comes with practice. The syntax isn't difficult, but remembering all of the properties and thier effect can be tricky,
          especially paddding, margin, content, and border. These three can seem interchangable but they are much more complex than you may thnk;  for example:</p><br>
          
          <code>
            #navbar {<br>
              background-color: lightgrey;<br>
              flex-direction: column;<br>
              width: 200px;<br>
              min-width: fit-content;<br>
              height: 100%;<br>
              position: fixed;<br>
              color: darkslategrey;<br>
              border-right: 2px solid darkslategray<br>
            }   <br>
          </code>
        
          <p>This code is what I used to make the navigation bar on the left (there is actually more to get the exact design you see but you get the point). These 
            properties take a while to grasp but once it clicks it becomes so much easier. Here is a simple explination of each property: <br>
            <ul class="vs">
              <li><heade id=content>Content</header> &ndash; The content of the box, where text and images appear</li>
              <li><heade id="padding">Padding</header> &ndash; Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent</li>
              <li><heade id="border">Border</header> &ndash; A border that goes around the padding and content</li>
              <li><heade id="margin">Margin</header> &ndash; Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>I have found ist easier to start my CSS stylesheets with this code:</p>
          
          <code>
            /* Reset styles */<br>
body, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, ul, ol, li, figure, figcaption, blockquote, dl, dd {<br>
  margin: 0;<br>
  padding: 0;<br>
}<br>
           </code>
          
           <p >This resets all of the margin and padding to zero and allows you to start from scratch.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_and_Java">
        <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
        <p>I'll be honest; I don't know much about Javascript; but I do know it needs to be implemented to make a modern website</p>
        <p>I did find one fun fact: you can use "userscript" in chrome to add your own funtions to use while surffing the web, for instance; I 
          downloaded the "tampermonkey" extension on Chrome and used this function:<br></p>
          
            <code>
              (function() {<br>
                'use strict';<br>
                   if (event.key === "Shift") {<br>
                    <br>
                // Function to search Google for highlighted text<br>
                function searchGoogle() {<br>
                    var selection = window.getSelection().toString();<br>
            
                         if (selection) {<br>
                        var url = "https://www.google.com/search?q=" + encodeURIComponent(selection);<br>
                        window.open(url, "_blank");<br>
                         }<br>
                    }<br>
                }<br>
                <br>
                // Register keyboard shortcut<br>
                GM_registerMenuCommand("Search Google for Highlighted Text", searchGoogle);<br>
            })();<br>
            </code>
          
          <p>This function lets me highlight text online and quicly google it in a new tab. Here is a list of what  I do know:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It's important</li>
          <li>It's cool</li>
          <li>It can do alot!</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Frontend">
        <header>Frontend</header>
        <p>Frontend is pretty much what you see when you open a website and the primary languages are HTML and CSS. The best way to learn this is to 
          figure out some HTML and CSS codes and try it out. Thats that I did and quickly learned that .classes are super importamt for example </p><br>
          
            <code>
              "(section class="main-section)"<br>
           </code>
          
          <p>This class selector allowed me to use the following CSS to make this page:</p><br>
          
            <code>
              #main-doc {<br>
                padding-left: 250px;<br>
                padding-top: 50px;<br>
                line-height: 1.5;<br>
              }<br>
            </code>
          
          <p>This section of code is in my CSS stylesheet and makes this site much easier to read.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Backend">
        <header>Backend</header>
        <p>I put everything I knew in the Javascript section. Other than that I can say that there is so much to learn about backend.</p>
